TASK TO AI = VERIFY THIS EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT REPORT — check if all findings are valid, consistent, and aligned with the system’s actual design and runtime. Highlight mismatches, blind spots, or overstatements. Confirm strengths, weaknesses, and whether the recommendations are truly actionable



Executive assessment
The .mdc model is clear and powerful (always-on vs auto-attach vs agent-requested), but runtime enforcement and safety around orchestration are inconsistent. This creates a “docs say X, runtime does Y” risk.
The system’s biggest weaknesses are: unenforced gates, dual/fragmented decision-scoring schemas, brittle registry parsing/IDs, missing safety guardrails on command execution, and tests depending on a non-existent external CLI.
Inputs, outputs, constraints (by subsystem)
Orchestrator router (.mdc)
Inputs: presence of artifacts in memory-bank/plan/**, optional domain attachments.
Outputs: suggestions only (not execution).
Constraints: currently advisory; no runtime validator consumes these gates before executing.
Decision scoring
Inputs: candidates with either metrics or scores (inconsistent across two pipelines).
Outputs: ranked candidates and a decision type; optional shadow/explore modes.
Constraints: schema divergence causes real risk of mis-interpretation downstream.
Trigger/registry execution
Inputs: scorer result + .cursor/commands/registry.yaml.
Outputs: selected command invocation.
Constraints: registry file isn’t valid YAML (heredoc content), IDs contain unicode arrows/spaces, brittle regex parsing; no strong runtime guard for contexts/gates.
Runner/plugins
Inputs: memory-bank/* artifacts.
Outputs: artifacts (with provenance) and state transitions.
Constraints: file-system based; lacks locking for concurrent runs and recovery semantics.
Observability/provenance
Inputs: events.jsonl and emitted artifacts.
Outputs: summary reports and hash index.
Constraints: limited correlation; hard to trace decision → command → state → artifacts.
Tests/CI
Inputs: pytest, networkx (ok), arx CLI (missing).
Outputs: smoke and integration checks.
Constraints: tests relying on arx will fail in a clean environment; CI not defined.
Top gaps, conflicts, blind spots
Enforced gates are missing at runtime
Router is advisory; trigger_next.py does not validate “must_exist” preconditions or router gates. A candidate can be selected even if prerequisites are absent.
Two decision pipelines with incompatible schemas
score.py expects metrics; advanced_score.py expects scores (+calibration/sigmoid). This can silently mis-rank or drop candidates.
Registry “YAML” is not valid YAML; IDs mismatch scoring candidates
File contains heredoc preface; parsed via regex; many IDs (e.g., “planning → audit”) don’t match scorer candidate IDs (“planning_from_backlog”), so mapping fails.
Safety and execution guardrails are weak by default
trigger_next.py runs real commands unless --dry-run is passed; no allowlist, no environment gate, no contained sandbox, no checksum validation.
Tests depend on a missing external CLI (arx)
Causes failing tests in clean environments; reduces signal.
Concurrency and integrity risks around filesystem state
No file locks on workflow_state.json; backups are ad-hoc; partial writes or concurrent runs can corrupt state.
Cycle detection in planning appears incomplete
Test expecting cycle detection fails; indicates a logic gap in TaskDecomposer.validate_task_graph.
“Attached domain” is referenced but not codified
Rules use attached("domain_python")/("domain_node") but runtime attachment evidence isn’t produced/consumed programmatically.
Observability lacks correlation
No correlation ID carried across decision → trigger → state → artifact; difficult to audit causality.
Registry governance
No schema validation for registry entries; no pre-flight validation of arguments/side effects.
Edge cases to address now
Multiple valid candidates with near-tie scores → deterministic tie-break that respects cost/risk policies.
Partially present artifacts (e.g., Action_Plan.md exists but empty) → guard on size/content schema, not just existence.
Concurrent triggers opening/overwriting workflow_state.json without atomic write → use write-temp→fsync→rename.
Platform paths and unicode in registry IDs → normalize before mapping (ASCII-only IDs).
Dry-run documented but forgotten in scripts → centralize default to “dry-run unless ALLOW_RUN=1”.
Recommendations (prioritized, actionable)
1) Enforce gates and contexts in the trigger path
Add a gate evaluator that produces gate_results.json from .mdc router + current artifacts.
In trigger_next.py, before running any command:
Validate: must_exist paths, required states, gates (PLANNING_GATE, AUDIT_GATE…), and domain attachment predicates.
Refuse execution with a crisp error listing the missing inputs.
2) Standardize on one scoring schema and adapter
Adopt advanced_score.py as the canonical scorer.
Add a thin adapter that converts legacy “metrics” candidates into canonical “scores”.
Validate input with a Pydantic/JSONSchema; reject unknown keys or missing required dimensions.
3) Fix the registry format and IDs; load with YAML
Replace heredoc content with valid YAML (no shell preface). Load via yaml.safe_load.
Normalize command IDs to ASCII kebab (e.g., planning-to-audit, audit-to-verify).
Add a preflight validator for registry schema (id uniqueness; shell as array of strings; contexts/gates/states typed).
4) Harden execution safety
Default to dry-run unless ALLOW_RUN=1.
Enforce command allowlist (e.g., only python3, arx subcommands; deny destructive utilities unless explicitly allowed).
Optionally sandbox with a profile (e.g., Docker/Firejail) for COMMAND_TRIGGER executions.
Require a checksum or signature over the registry (tamper detection).
5) Make gates programmatic and observable
Implement a “gate evaluator” module (inputs: router.mdc + artifacts + state; output: gate_results.json).
Emit a correlation ID on decision → trigger → state transition → artifact writes; aggregate by ID in observability.
6) Stabilize tests and CI
Provide a local stub for arx CLI (no-op responses) used by tests, or mark those tests as skipped when arx is not on PATH.
Add GitHub Actions that run: lint, unit tests, gate evaluator, schema validation, and scorer smoke.
Ensure test deps are declared (pytest, networkx, pyyaml).
7) Improve state integrity and concurrency
Use file locks (fcntl or portalocker) for workflow_state.json reads/writes; adopt atomic write (temp→fsync→rename) and keep a rolling backup.
Consider migrating provenance and decisions to SQLite with indexed tables while keeping file artifacts as the canonical source.
8) Observability and auditability
Extend aggregate.py to report per-correlation metrics, decision distributions (NEXT_STEP vs OPTION_SET), and gate-failure reasons.
Emit decision traces with reasons and include them in reports.
9) Developer experience and maintainability
Replace regex parsing with structured parsers everywhere (registry, candidates).
Add type hints across tools; enable mypy in CI.
Consolidate duplicate utilities (write_text/append_event appear in multiple modules) to a single IO layer.
10) .mdc hygiene and runtime parity
Add a linter for .mdc rules: check frontmatter completeness, valid globs, and prohibited patterns.
Generate a machine-readable index (rules → gates → required artifacts) and compare it against the gate evaluator to keep docs and runtime aligned.
Questions to de-risk scope (answer to finalize plan)
Domain attachments: What is the canonical source of “attached(domain_)”? Should this be derived (e.g., via .cursor/rules/domains/ presence) or explicitly configured?
Command execution policy: Which commands are permitted for COMMAND_TRIGGER? Can we formalize an allowlist and a sandbox profile?
Registry change control: Should registry changes require review/signoff? Do we want a checksum/signature?
Runner concurrency: Is parallel persona execution expected? If yes, we need explicit locking semantics and queueing.
Artifact validation: Should artifact existence checks be upgraded to schema/content checks? If so, which artifacts must be strongly validated (e.g., acceptance_criteria.json)?
CI policy: Which gates (prestart, planning, audit) must pass before merging to main?
UX polish (fast wins)
Consistently default all CLI helpers to dry-run and print “How to enable execution” hints.
On any rejection (missing artifact/gate), print the exact file and the one-liner to create/validate it.
Provide arx test stub or a “developer mode” that replaces arx with local functions to keep tests green out-of-the-box.
Normalize messages and IDs: ASCII-only, kebab-case, predictable mapping from router → scorer → registry.
If you want, I can draft:
A canonical YAML schema for candidates, decisions, and registry entries.
A gate evaluator spec and a minimal reference implementation.
A migration PR that: fixes registry YAML, normalizes IDs, enforces dry-run default, and adds command allowlist + unit tests.

VERIFY: Executive assessment vs repo/runtime

Overall: Mostly accurate. Key gaps confirmed: unenforced runtime gates, dual/fragmented scoring schemas, invalid registry YAML + brittle regex loader, weak execution guardrails, missing correlation in observability, and no locking/atomicity for state/files. Two overstatements: CI exists and installs arx; cycle detection is implemented and tested (though dependency handling is fragile).

Verdict on each claim
- Enforced gates missing at runtime → VALID
  - Router `.mdc` is advisory; `tools/orchestrator/trigger_next.py` does not validate `must_exist`/gates/states before running commands.
- Two decision pipelines with incompatible schemas → VALID
  - `tools/decision_scoring/score.py` expects metrics under `metrics`; `advanced_score.py` expects `scores`. `trigger_next.py` imports `advanced_score.py`.
- Registry “YAML” invalid; brittle parsing; IDs mismatch → VALID
  - `.cursor/commands/registry.yaml` starts with a heredoc preface and has non-ASCII IDs like “planning → audit”. Loader in `trigger_next.py` uses regex; scorer’s candidate IDs won’t consistently map (e.g., `planning_from_backlog`).
- Safety and execution guardrails weak by default → VALID
  - `trigger_next.py` executes unless `--dry-run` is passed; no allowlist/sandbox/signature checks.
- Tests depend on missing external CLI (arx) → PARTIALLY VALID
  - Locally, without `pip install -e .`, tests that call `arx` will fail. CI workflow installs the package, providing `arx`.
- Concurrency/integrity risks on filesystem state → VALID
  - `workflow_state.json` and `logs/events.jsonl` are written without locks or atomic rename; risk of corruption under concurrency/partial writes.
- Cycle detection in planning appears incomplete → PARTIALLY VALID
  - Cycle detection exists (`networkx`) and tests cover cycles; logic passes. However, dependency keys are step descriptions, which is brittle.
- “Attached domain” referenced but not codified → VALID
  - Router rules use `attached("domain_python")`, but there’s no runtime evaluator/attachment mechanism consumed by the trigger path.
- Observability lacks correlation → VALID
  - Events track counts/durations only; no correlation ID through decision → trigger → state → artifacts. `orchestrator_postrun.py` references a non-existent `DecisionScoringTool`.
- Registry governance → VALID
  - No YAML loader, no schema validation or ID normalization.
- Router outputs suggestions only → VALID
  - No gate evaluator feeds into trigger execution.

Inputs/outputs/constraints by subsystem (validated)
- Orchestrator router (.mdc)
  - Inputs: memory-bank presence; optional “domain attachments”
  - Outputs: suggestions only
  - Constraints: advisory; not enforced at runtime
- Decision scoring
  - Inputs: candidates (in two schemas)
  - Outputs: ranked candidates + decision; optional shadow/explore
  - Constraints: schema divergence risks misinterpretation
- Trigger/registry execution
  - Inputs: scorer result + registry mapping
  - Outputs: command invocation
  - Constraints: regex parsing; invalid YAML; non-ASCII IDs; no gates enforced
- Runner/plugins
  - Inputs: memory-bank artifacts
  - Outputs: artifacts + events
  - Constraints: FS-based; no locking/atomic writes
- Observability/provenance
  - Inputs: `logs/events.jsonl`, emitted artifacts
  - Outputs: summaries under `logs/observability`
  - Constraints: limited correlation; no decision→command→state linkage
- Tests/CI
  - Inputs: pytest, networkx, arx
  - Outputs: smoke/e2e checks
  - Constraints: local runs fail if arx not installed; CI installs arx via editable install

Notable mismatches/overstatements
- “Tests rely on arx and CI not defined” → Overstated: CI exists (`.github/workflows/rag-check.yml`) and installs `arx`.
- “Cycle detection incomplete” → Overstated: Detectors and tests exist; fragility is in dependency keying by description.

Strengths confirmed
- Clear .mdc taxonomy and router rules for phases/gates.
- Modern scorer (`advanced_score.py`) with calibration/thresholds and explore/shadow modes.
- Provenance index with SHA-256 for memory-bank artifacts.
- E2E golden path generating multiple artifacts and logging events.
- CI pipeline sanity-checking CLI and RAG ops.

Weaknesses confirmed
- No runtime enforcement of gates/contexts before triggers.
- Dual scoring schemas (legacy metrics vs canonical scores).
- Registry format invalid + regex loader + non-ASCII/un-normalized IDs.
- Execution safety defaults to “run” (no allowlist/sandbox/signing).
- No file locking/atomic writes or recovery semantics.
- No correlation IDs in observability.
- Domain “attachments” in rules not wired into runtime.
- Orchestrator postrun references an absent `DecisionScoringTool`.

Actionability of recommendations (yes = directly implementable here)
1) Enforce gates/contexts in trigger path → YES
   - Implement gate evaluator producing `gate_results.json`; validate `must_exist`, required states, gates, and attachments before run.
2) Standardize on one scoring schema + adapter → YES
   - Use `advanced_score.py` canonically; adapt legacy “metrics” → “scores”; validate via pydantic/JSONSchema.
3) Fix registry format/IDs; load with YAML → YES
   - Remove heredoc; `yaml.safe_load`; normalize IDs to ASCII kebab; add preflight validator.
4) Harden execution safety → YES
   - Default dry-run unless `ALLOW_RUN=1`; command allowlist; optional sandbox (Firejail/Docker); registry checksum/signature.
5) Make gates programmatic/observable → YES
   - Emit correlation IDs and `gate_results.json`; propagate through decision→trigger→state/artifacts; update observability.
6) Stabilize tests/CI → YES
   - Local arx stub or skip if not on PATH; ensure deps; docs: `pip install -e .`.
7) Improve state integrity/concurrency → YES
   - File locks and atomic writes (temp→fsync→rename); rolling backup; consider SQLite for decisions/provenance.
8) Observability/auditability → YES
   - Aggregate per-correlation, decision distributions, gate-failure reasons; emit decision traces with reasons.
9) Developer experience → YES
   - Replace regex parsers; add types + mypy; consolidate IO utilities.
10) .mdc hygiene/runtime parity → YES
   - .mdc linter; machine-readable index of rules→gates→artifacts; compare with gate evaluator.

Quick-source evidence (paths/lines)
1) Trigger path lacks gates; runs unless --dry-run
```1:83:/workspace/tools/orchestrator/trigger_next.py
def run_shell(cmd: list, dry_run: bool) -> None:
    if dry_run:
        print("DRY_RUN:", " ".join(cmd))
        return
    subprocess.check_call(cmd, cwd=str(ROOT))
...
cmd_id = res["candidates"][0]["id"]
if cmd_id not in mapping:
    print(f"No registry mapping for id: {cmd_id}")
    return
run_shell(mapping[cmd_id], args.dry_run)
```

2) Invalid registry YAML + non-ASCII IDs
```1:152:/workspace/.cursor/commands/registry.yaml
cat > .cursor/commands/registry.yaml <<'YAML'
...
- id: planning → audit
...
shell: ["python3","tools/run_role.py","auditor_ai","--inputs","memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md"]
```

3) Divergent scoring schemas
```1:113:/workspace/tools/decision_scoring/advanced_score.py
def score_candidates(candidates: List[Dict[str, Any]], ...):
    comps = _collect_scores(c)  # expects scores
```
```1:152:/workspace/tools/decision_scoring/score.py
def score_candidate(c, W):
    m = c.get("metrics", {})  # expects metrics
```

4) State/IO non-atomic, no locks
```1:59:/workspace/tools/orchestrator/state.py
def save_state(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    STATE_FILE.write_text(json.dumps(data, indent=2), encoding="utf-8")
```
```1:45:/workspace/tools/runner/io_utils.py
def append_event(evt):
    content = (EVENTS.read_text() if EVENTS.exists() else "") + json.dumps(evt) + "\n"
    EVENTS.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")
```

5) CI sets up arx (counter to “CI not defined”)
```1:43:/workspace/.github/workflows/rag-check.yml
- name: Install deps + package (creates `arx` console script)
  run: |
    python -m pip install -e .
```

6) Router references attached domains; no runtime evaluator
```1:79:/workspace/.cursor/rules/orchestrator/scenario_router.mdc
and([
  not(attached("domain_python")),
  not(attached("domain_node"))
])
```

Final call
- Assessment is largely correct. Overstatements: CI exists (installs arx); cycle detection is implemented and tested, though dependency keying is fragile.
- Recommendations are actionable and map cleanly to present code gaps.

Optional next steps I can implement on request
- Gate evaluator + preflight in `trigger_next.py`
- YAML loader + ID normalization for `registry.yaml` (and schema validator)
- Default dry-run via env, command allowlist, optional sandbox
- Correlation IDs across decision→trigger→state→artifacts; extend `aggregate.py`
- Adapter for legacy metrics→scores; pydantic validation for scoring inputs
