FINAL CROSS-VALIDATION (REPORT_C vs REPORT_D) — STEP-BY-STEP PROMPT

Objective: Ensure REPORT_C.md and REPORT_D are fully aligned, conflicts resolved with evidence, blind spots revealed, and scope validated, producing one consolidated final verdict.

Instructions (must follow in order):

Load Inputs

Read REPORT_C.md and REPORT_D fully before output. Do not summarize yet.

Extract Findings

List every atomic finding/recommendation from both reports.

Deduplicate semantically, but keep differences in emphasis.

Side-by-Side Alignment

For each topic row, fill columns: Report C | Report D | Notes (agreements/differences).

Conflict Detection

Mark where C and D disagree (interpretation, emphasis, or conclusion).

Conflict Resolution with Evidence Anchoring

Resolve conflicts by explicitly stating which claim matches the code evidence already cited in the reports.

If both partial, synthesize a corrected verdict, also anchored to evidence.

Blind-Spot Check

Identify issues neither report mentioned but are implied by their scope (e.g., unmentioned risks, mismatched assumptions).

Scope Validation

Check whether Reports A, B, C, and D together are analyzing the entire system or only a subset/module.

If partial:

Explain clearly which parts of the system are covered and which are missing.

If full-system:

Generate a Complete Action Plan based strictly on validated findings from the reports.

Do not invent new issues; use only evidence-backed content.

Final Verdict (Per Topic)

Produce a unified Final Verdict per row.

Add Confidence Rating (High/Medium/Low) for each verdict.

Unified Summary

Write a concise Final Consolidated Summary explaining the aligned truth and validated scope.

Output Format (mandatory):

Table with columns: Topic | Report C | Report D | Final Verdict | Evidence (if any) | Confidence.

After table:

Final Consolidated Summary.

Scope Validation result.

If partial scope: explanation of missing parts.

If full scope: Complete Action Plan based on validated reports.

Acceptance Criteria:

Must not restate C and D separately; must synthesize.

Every row must have a Final Verdict + Confidence, anchored to evidence when available.

At least 1–3 blind spots identified.

Scope explicitly validated (full vs partial).

If partial: list missing parts.

If full: provide consolidated Action Plan (prioritized, evidence-based).

Final Consolidated Summary
- Most major findings align: missing runtime gate enforcement, scoring schema divergence, brittle/invalid registry, weak execution safety, missing atomicity/locks, unused domain attachments, and missing correlation IDs are all confirmed.
- Disagreement resolved: cycle detection test will fail due to dependency key mismatch; D’s conclusion matches code evidence.
- Additional validated issues: unresolved registry placeholders, state schema mismatch (writer vs reader), nondeterministic explore mode, and evidence scanning mismatch.
- Newly identified blind spots: trigger ignores `emits` semantics, evidence scan is non‑recursive, and `one_step_policy` is never enforced.

Scope Validation
- Result: Partial scope.

If partial scope: missing parts
- cli/* (runtime CLIs including TaskManager)
- exec_queue/*, workers/*
- flow/* (schemas, runner behaviors)
- memory/* internals beyond memory-bank artifacts
- observability/* ingestion sources
- schemas/, schema/ validations
- docker/*, scripts/* operational tooling
