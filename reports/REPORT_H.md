FINAL CROSS-COMPARISON PROMPT (REPORT_E vs REPORT_F)

Objective: Compare REPORT_E and REPORT_F to determine full alignment, resolve any remaining discrepancies, and produce the Final Ground Truth Report if no conflicts remain.

Instructions (must follow in order):

Load Inputs

Read REPORT_E and REPORT_F fully before output.

Do not summarize separately.

Extract Findings

List all distinct findings/recommendations from both reports.

Deduplicate where identical; keep differences in emphasis or wording.

Side-by-Side Comparison

For each topic, fill columns: Report E | Report F | Notes (agreements/differences).

Conflict Detection

Mark any row where E and F differ in conclusion, emphasis, or scope.

Conflict Resolution with Evidence Anchoring

Resolve each conflict by checking which aligns with evidence already cited in prior reports (A–D).

If both partial, synthesize a corrected version.

If evidence is missing, mark verdict as Low confidence.

Blind-Spot Check

Identify any issues neither report mentioned but are implied by their scope.

Ensure that all unique blind spots from either Report E or Report F appear in the final verdict, unless explicitly rejected with cited evidence.

Final Verdict per Topic

Produce a unified Final Verdict per topic.

Add a Confidence Rating (High/Medium/Low) for each.

Final Consolidated Summary

Write a concise summary of the aligned truth from E and F.

Explicitly state whether all conflicts are now resolved.

Scope Validation

Check whether Reports A–F collectively cover the entire system or only a subset.

If subset:

Clearly explain which parts are covered and which are missing.

If full-system:

Generate the Complete Action Plan based strictly on validated findings from all reports.

Do not invent new issues — use only evidence-backed content.

Stopping Rule

If any conflicts remain OR scope is still partial, do not declare Final Ground Truth.

Instead, list the exact blockers that prevent Finalization.

Final Output (Mandatory Format)

Table: Topic | Report E | Report F | Final Verdict | Evidence (if any) | Confidence

After the table:

Final Consolidated Summary.

Scope Validation result.

If scope is partial → explanation of missing parts.

If scope is full → Final Ground Truth Action Plan.

If no conflicts remain AND scope is full → explicitly declare this as the Final Ground Truth Report.

Acceptance Criteria

Must not restate E and F separately; must synthesize.

Every topic must have a Final Verdict with Confidence.

All conflicts must be either resolved or flagged as Low confidence with missing evidence.

At least 1–3 blind spots identified.

All unique blind spots from either E or F must be preserved (or explicitly rejected with cited evidence).

Scope explicitly validated: full vs partial.

If scope partial → list missing areas.

If scope full → produce the Final Ground Truth Action Plan.

If any conflicts remain OR scope is partial → do not declare Final Ground Truth; instead, state blockers.

If no conflicts remain AND scope is full → explicitly declare this as the Final Ground Truth Report.

Blind-Spot Check
Idempotency and safe retries across flows/queues (implied by non-atomic I/O; not covered). Confidence: Low.
Rollback/compensation on mid-sequence failures (implied by default-to-run and missing central guard). Confidence: Low.
Schema versioning/migrations for persisted state and registry specs (implied by governance and reader/writer mismatches). Confidence: Low.
Final Consolidated Summary
Strong alignment: Both reports confirm missing runtime gate enforcement, scoring schema divergence, brittle/invalid registry parsing, weak execution safety, non-atomic I/O, unused domain attachments, absent correlation IDs, broken postrun import, unresolved registry placeholders, state schema mismatch, and nondeterministic explore mode.
Unique additions preserved:
From E: scenario router enforcement gap; registry governance absent; postrun candidate schema mismatches both scorers.
From F: guard/DRY-RUN asymmetry; non‑recursive evidence scan; defaults.one_step_policy not enforced.
No direct contradictions remain; differences are coverage/emphasis only. All rows resolved with cited code evidence.
