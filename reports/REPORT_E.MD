FINAL CROSS-VALIDATION (REPORT_C vs REPORT_D) — STEP-BY-STEP PROMPT

Objective: Ensure REPORT_C.md and REPORT_D are fully aligned, conflicts resolved with evidence, blind spots revealed, and scope validated, producing one consolidated final verdict.

Instructions (must follow in order):

Load Inputs

Read REPORT_C.md and REPORT_D fully before output. Do not summarize yet.

Extract Findings

List every atomic finding/recommendation from both reports.

Deduplicate semantically, but keep differences in emphasis.

Side-by-Side Alignment

For each topic row, fill columns: Report C | Report D | Notes (agreements/differences).

Conflict Detection

Mark where C and D disagree (interpretation, emphasis, or conclusion).

Conflict Resolution with Evidence Anchoring

Resolve conflicts by explicitly stating which claim matches the code evidence already cited in the reports.

If both partial, synthesize a corrected verdict, also anchored to evidence.

Blind-Spot Check

Identify issues neither report mentioned but are implied by their scope (e.g., unmentioned risks, mismatched assumptions).

Scope Validation

Check whether Reports A, B, C, and D together are analyzing the entire system or only a subset/module.

If partial:

Explain clearly which parts of the system are covered and which are missing.

If full-system:

Generate a Complete Action Plan based strictly on validated findings from the reports.

Do not invent new issues; use only evidence-backed content.

Final Verdict (Per Topic)

Produce a unified Final Verdict per row.

Add Confidence Rating (High/Medium/Low) for each verdict.

Unified Summary

Write a concise Final Consolidated Summary explaining the aligned truth and validated scope.

Output Format (mandatory):

Table with columns: Topic | Report C | Report D | Final Verdict | Evidence (if any) | Confidence.

After table:

Final Consolidated Summary.

Scope Validation result.

If partial scope: explanation of missing parts.

If full scope: Complete Action Plan based on validated reports.

Acceptance Criteria:

Must not restate C and D separately; must synthesize.

Every row must have a Final Verdict + Confidence, anchored to evidence when available.

At least 1–3 blind spots identified.

Scope explicitly validated (full vs partial).

If partial: list missing parts.

If full: provide consolidated Action Plan (prioritized, evidence-based).

### Consolidated Alignment Table
| Topic | Report C | Report D | Final Verdict | Evidence (if any) | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime gates not enforced before trigger | Calls out | Calls out | Confirmed: trigger executes top candidate without gate/context/state validation | [E1], [E3] | High |
| Dual scoring schemas (metrics vs scores) | Calls out | Calls out | Confirmed: advanced scorer expects scores; legacy scorer expects metrics | [E2] | High |
| Registry invalid YAML + regex loader + non-ASCII IDs | Calls out | Calls out | Confirmed: heredoc preface; unicode IDs; regex-only loader ignores requires/contexts | [E3] | High |
| Execution safety defaults to run; no allowlist/sandbox/signing | Calls out | Calls out | Confirmed: executes unless --dry-run; no guardrails | [E1] | High |
| Filesystem state/events: no locks or atomic writes | Calls out | Calls out | Confirmed: direct writes, no atomic rename/locks | [E5] | High |
| “Attached domain” referenced but not codified in runtime | Calls out | Calls out | Confirmed: `attached(...)` only in rules; trigger ignores | [E6] | High |
| Observability lacks correlation IDs | Calls out | Calls out | Confirmed: counts/durations only; no correlation threading | [E7] | High |
| Orchestrator postrun imports missing DecisionScoringTool | Calls out | Calls out | Confirmed: import expects class that does not exist in `score.py` | [E8] | High |
| Cycle detection in planning | Says “overstated; fragility in dependency keying” | Says “A correct; test will fail” | Resolved: Test fails due to ID vs description mismatch; cycle msg not emitted | [E9] | High |
| CI not defined; tests rely on missing arx | Says “overstated; CI exists; local arx may be missing” | Says “A incorrect; CI installs arx” | Resolved: CI installs arx; locally missing arx breaks tests | [E10] | High |
| Scenario router advisory-only (not enforced) | Calls out explicitly | Implicit via gate-enforcement gap | Confirmed: Router suggests; trigger doesn’t enforce | [E1], [E6] | High |
| Registry governance (schema/ID validation) absent | Calls out | Calls out (via recs) | Confirmed: no schema/ID validation; regex parsing only | [E3] | High |
| Blind spot: Workflow state schema mismatch (state vs status/current_goal) | Not mentioned | Calls out | Confirmed: writer uses state/prev_state/history; postrun reads status/current_goal | [E13] | High |
| Blind spot: Non-deterministic trigger (explore ties reversed) | Not mentioned | Calls out | Confirmed: `explore=True` + minute bucket flips candidate order near ties | [E11] | High |
| Blind spot: Postrun evidence scan mismatch (.json only) | Not mentioned | Calls out | Confirmed: scans reports/*.json while repo uses reports/*.md | [E12] | High |
| Blind spot: Template substitution missing in trigger path | Calls out | Not mentioned | Confirmed: registry templates like {{flow_id}} never substituted in trigger | [E14] | High |
| Blind spot: Duplicated append_event implementations | Calls out | Not mentioned | Confirmed: duplicate in `io_utils.py` and `run_role.py` | [E15] | Medium |
| Blind spot: Postrun decisions siloed from events (no cross-link) | Calls out | Not mentioned | Confirmed: postrun writes logs/decisions; aggregator reads logs/events.jsonl | [E16] | Medium |
| Blind spot (new): Registry emits not applied by trigger | Not mentioned | Not mentioned | Confirmed: trigger doesn’t enact `emits.sets_state`/`add_completed_step` | [E17] | High |
| Blind spot (new): Postrun candidate schema mismatches both scorers | Not mentioned | Not mentioned | Confirmed: candidates top-level metrics don’t match required nested schemas | [E18] | High |

### Final Consolidated Summary
- Core gaps conclusively validated by both reports and code: lack of runtime gate enforcement, incompatible scoring schemas, brittle/invalid registry parsing with unicode IDs, weak execution safety defaults, non-atomic I/O, unused domain attachments at runtime, and minimal observability (no correlation).
- Conflicts resolved:
  - Cycle detection: Test will fail due to dependency key mismatch (IDs vs descriptions); D is correct, C’s “overstated” reframed as root-cause fragility.
  - CI/arx: CI is present and installs `arx`; local runs may fail without local `arx`—both points reconciled.
- Additional blind spots validated: state schema mismatch in postrun, nondeterministic tie-flips from exploration, evidence scan limited to `.json`, missing template substitution for registry shells, duplicated `append_event`, siloed decision logs vs events, registry `emits` not applied by trigger, and postrun candidate schema incompatible with both scorers.

### Scope Validation
- Result: Partial scope.
- Covered: `tools/orchestrator/*`, `tools/decision_scoring/*`, `reports/*`, planning tests, `.cursor/commands/registry.yaml`, `tools/observability/aggregate.py`, `tools/runner/io_utils.py`.
- Missing/not analyzed: 
  - `cli/*` (`ar_flow.py`, `ar_memory.py`, `ar_tasks.py`, `main.py`)
  - `tools/runner/plugins/*` (role behaviors)
  - `tools/artifacts/*` (hash index/provenance)
  - `tools/flow/*` (flow semantics)
  - `tools/rule_attach/*`
  - `tools/instrumentation.py`
  - broader `tools/rules/*` beyond scenario router
