  strategic_layer:      # C-Level equivalent
    - product_owner_ai: "Business strategy & requirements"
    - planning_ai: "Project roadmap & technical planning"

  technical_leadership: # Senior Developer/Architect equivalent
    - principal_engineer_ai: "Architecture & technical decisions"

```

## Workflow Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Agile Sprint Simulation
```typescript
interface SprintWorkflow {
  planning: {
    product_owner: "Define sprint goals & user stories";
    planning_ai: "Break down into tasks & estimate effort";
    principal_engineer: "Technical feasibility assessment";
  };
  development: {
    codegen_ai: "Implement features with TDD approach";
    qa_ai: "Continuous testing & validation";
    security_ai: "Security review during development";
  };
  review: {
    auditor_ai: "Code quality & standards compliance";
    documentation_ai: "Update documentation";
  };
  deployment: {
    security_ai: "Final security assessment";
    qa_ai: "Integration & performance testing";
  };
}
```

### 2. Code Review Simulation
```yaml

  automated_checks:
    - syntax_validation: "Automated linting & formatting"
    - security_scan: "Vulnerability assessment"
    - performance_analysis: "Resource usage optimization"

```

## Context Management Strategies

### Memory Bridge Enhancement
```yaml

  project_memory:     # Persistent project knowledge
    - requirements_history: "Evolution of requirements"
    - architectural_decisions: "Technical choices & rationale"
    - code_patterns: "Established coding standards"

  session_memory:     # Current development session
    - active_tasks: "Current sprint items"
    - recent_changes: "Latest modifications"
    - pending_reviews: "Items awaiting review"

  team_memory:       # AI persona coordination
    - handoffs: "Information passed between personas"
    - decisions: "Important choices & justifications"
    - learnings: "Lessons learned from previous iterations"
```

### Smart Context Switching
```typescript
