TASK =

COMPARE AND VERIFY — Take Report_A.md and Report_B.md, then cross-check them directly against the actual codebase. Identify: (1) which findings are confirmed by code inspection, (2) which findings are exaggerated or incorrect, (3) which blind spots neither report mentioned, and (4) which recommendations are truly implementable given the code. Output a side-by-side comparison (Report_A.md vs Report_B.d vs Codebase)




REPORT =





Side-by-side comparison (Report A vs Report B vs Codebase)

- CONFIRMED: Router/gates not enforced at runtime
  - Report A: Claims router is advisory; no pre-run validation.
  - Report B: Same; cites trigger_next.py.
  - Codebase: trigger_next.py scores, maps id→shell, runs; no gate checks.
    /workspace/tools/orchestrator/trigger_next.py (excerpt)
      def run_shell(cmd: list, dry_run: bool) -> None:
          if dry_run:
              print("DRY_RUN:", " ".join(cmd))
              return
          subprocess.check_call(cmd, cwd=str(ROOT))
      ...
      cmd_id = res["candidates"][0]["id"]
      if cmd_id not in mapping:
          print(f"No registry mapping for id: {cmd_id}")
          return
      run_shell(mapping[cmd_id], args.dry_run)

- CONFIRMED: Dual, incompatible scoring schemas
  - Report A: score.py expects metrics; advanced_score.py expects scores.
  - Report B: Same; notes trigger_next.py uses advanced_score.py.
  - Codebase:
    /workspace/tools/decision_scoring/advanced_score.py (excerpt)
      def score_candidates(candidates: List[Dict[str, Any]], ...):
          comps = _collect_scores(c)  # expects scores
    /workspace/tools/decision_scoring/score.py (excerpt)
      def score_candidate(c, W):
          m = c.get("metrics", {})  # expects metrics

- CONFIRMED: Registry invalid for programmatic load; brittle regex parsing; non-ASCII IDs; contexts ignored
  - Report A: Heredoc preface, unicode arrows, regex loader, mapping mismatch.
  - Report B: Same; shows specific examples.
  - Codebase:
    /workspace/.cursor/commands/registry.yaml (excerpt)
      cat > .cursor/commands/registry.yaml <<'YAML'
      ...
      - id: planning → audit
      ...
      shell: ["python3","tools/run_role.py","auditor_ai","--inputs","memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md"]
    /workspace/tools/orchestrator/trigger_next.py (excerpt)
      def load_registry_commands() -> dict:
          ...
          m_id = re.match(r"^\s*-\s+id:\s*(.+)$", raw)
          ...
          m_shell = re.match(r"^\s*shell:\s*(\[.*\])\s*$", raw)
          ...

- CONFIRMED: Execution safety defaults to run; no allowlist/sandbox/signature
  - Reports A/B: Highlight lack of guardrails and default behavior.
  - Codebase: run_shell executes unless --dry-run; no allowlist/sandbox.

- PARTIALLY VALID / OVERSTATED: Tests depend on missing arx, CI not defined
  - Report A: Says CI not defined; tests rely on missing CLI.
  - Report B: Corrects: CI exists and installs arx.
  - Codebase:
    /workspace/.github/workflows/rag-check.yml (excerpt)
      - name: Install deps + package (creates `arx` console script)
        run: |
          python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
          python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
          python -m pip install -e .
    /workspace/pyproject.toml (excerpt)
      [project.scripts]
      arx = "cli.main:main"
    /workspace/tests/test_memory_basic.py (excerpt)
      subprocess.check_call(["arx","memory","index", ...])
  - Verdict: Locally missing arx breaks tests unless installed; CI covers it.

- CONFIRMED: State/events I/O not atomic; no locks
  - Reports A/B: Mention atomic write and locks missing.
  - Codebase:
    /workspace/tools/orchestrator/state.py (excerpt)
      def save_state(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
          STATE_FILE.write_text(json.dumps(data, indent=2), encoding="utf-8")
    /workspace/tools/runner/io_utils.py (excerpt)
      def append_event(evt):
          content = (EVENTS.read_text() if EVENTS.exists() else "") + json.dumps(evt) + "\n"
          EVENTS.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")

- PARTIALLY VALID / OVERSTATED: Cycle detection “incomplete”
  - Report A: Says test expecting cycle detection fails.
  - Report B: Clarifies cycles handled; fragility in dependency keying by description.
  - Codebase:
    /workspace/tools/planning/task_decomposer.py (excerpt)
      if not nx.is_directed_acyclic_graph(G):
          issues.append("Task graph contains cycles")
    /workspace/tests/test_planning_pipeline.py (excerpt)
      assert not is_valid
      assert any("cycle" in issue.lower() for issue in issues)

- CONFIRMED: “Attached domain” referenced but not wired into trigger runtime
  - Reports A/B: Note lack of runtime use.
  - Codebase:
    /workspace/.cursor/rules/orchestrator/scenario_router.mdc (excerpt)
      and([
        not(attached("domain_python")),
        not(attached("domain_node"))
      ])
  - No consumption in trigger_next.py.

- CONFIRMED: Observability lacks correlation; postrun references non-existent tool
  - Reports A/B: Missing correlation IDs; postrun references DecisionScoringTool.
  - Codebase:
    /workspace/tools/orchestrator_postrun.py (excerpt)
      from score import DecisionScoringTool
  - No correlation propagation found; events are simple JSONL appends.

- CONFIRMED: Registry governance absent
  - Reports A/B: No schema/ID validation.
  - Codebase: No YAML loading/validation for .cursor/commands/registry.yaml.

- CONFIRMED: Router outputs suggestions only, not enforced
  - Reports A/B: Advisory only.
  - Codebase: scenario_router.mdc suggests/rejects; trigger_next.py doesn’t enforce.

Additional blind spots (underemphasized)
- Template substitution missing in trigger path: registry uses {{flow_id}}, {{task_id}} etc., but trigger_next.py never substitutes; even if parsed, parameters unresolved.
  /workspace/.cursor/commands/registry.yaml (excerpt)
    shell: ["arx","flow","run","--flow={{flow_id}}","--task-id={{task_id}}","--dry-run"]
- Duplicated IO helpers: append_event implemented in tools/runner/io_utils.py and redefined in tools/run_role.py.
- Asymmetry: flow runner has robust guards/dry-run pattern; orchestration trigger lacks similar enforcement (reusable guard module opportunity).
- Post-run decisions siloed: orchestrator_postrun.py logs to logs/decisions/ but not unified with logs/events.jsonl; no cross-link/correlation.

Implementability of recommendations (Yes/ready)
- Enforce gates/contexts in trigger path: add gate evaluator; validate must_exist/states/gates/attachments pre-exec in trigger_next.py.
- Standardize scoring on advanced_score.py + adapter: map legacy metrics→scores; add pydantic/JSONSchema validation.
- Fix registry format/IDs and YAML loading: remove heredoc, use yaml.safe_load, normalize to ASCII-kebab IDs; schema validation + preflight.
- Harden execution safety: default dry-run via env, command allowlist, optional sandboxing, registry checksum/signature.
- Programmatic/observable gates + correlation IDs: emit gate_results.json; propagate correlation id through decision→trigger→state→artifacts; extend aggregators.
- Stabilize tests/CI: local arx stub or skip when missing; ensure deps; CI already installs package.
- State integrity: file locks and atomic writes; rolling backups.
- Observability: aggregate per-correlation; emit decision traces.
- Developer experience: replace regex parsers; add types; dedupe IO utilities; enable mypy.
- .mdc hygiene: linter and machine-readable index.

Exaggerated or incorrect (vs code)
- “CI not defined / doesn’t install arx”: Incorrect. CI exists and installs arx (Report B corrected this).
- “Cycle detection appears incomplete (test fails)”: Overstated. Cycle detection and tests present; fragility is in dependency keying by descriptions.
