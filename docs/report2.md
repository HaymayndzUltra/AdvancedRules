 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY WITH CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
Overall Assessment: Good
Overall Confidence Score: 9/10 - High Confidence
Critical Issues: 6 high-priority items requiring immediate attention
Key Strengths:
Clear modular architecture and documentation - Confidence: 10/10
Decision scoring v3 with calibration/thresholds/shadow/exploration - Confidence: 9/10
State engine with history; provenance and attach-logs; observability - Confidence: 9/10
Runner plugins implement a working happy path - Confidence: 9/10
Major Gaps:
Orchestrator post-run uses DecisionScoringTool class not present - Confidence: 10/10
Candidate schema inconsistency (metrics vs scores) - Confidence: 9/10
Registry IDs and mappings incomplete/inconsistent with scorer IDs - Confidence: 9/10
Memory bridge/master toggle are docs, not code - Confidence: 9/10
Missing consolidated gate evaluator (gate_results.json producer) - Confidence: 9/10
Security hardening for command execution minimal - Confidence: 8/10
Recommendation: Fix decisionâ†’trigger integration, standardize schemas, add gate evaluator, harden safety, expand registry; then iterate.
Confidence Breakdown:
High Confidence (8-10): 18 findings
ðŸŸ¡ Medium Confidence (5-7): 3 findings
Low Confidence (1-4): 0 findings
VALIDATION RESULTS
1. Architecture Assessment - Confidence: 9/10
Validated Claims:
Modular dirs exist: .cursor/rules/*, tools/*, memory-bank/*, logs/* (verified via directory listings)
Scoring v3: tools/decision_scoring/advanced_score.py, weights.json, thresholds.json, calibration.json, features (exploration/shadow/decision_trace) present
State engine: tools/orchestrator/state.py reads/writes workflow_state.json with history
Provenance index: tools/artifacts/hash_index.py writes memory-bank/artifacts_index.json
Attach log: tools/rule_attach/detect.py writes logs/rule_attach_log.json
Observability: tools/observability/aggregate.py reads logs/events.jsonl and writes summaries
Runner/plugins: tools/run_role.py dispatches to tools/runner/plugins/*
Uncertain Claims: None material
Incorrect Claims: None detected
Confidence Factors: All mapped to concrete files and behavior; smoke tests exist
2. Workflow Analysis - Confidence: 9/10
Validated Workflows:
Prestart flow: tools/prestart/* ensures offer_status.json and prints preflight
Persona pipeline: PO â†’ Planning â†’ Auditor â†’ PE (PEER_REVIEW â†’ SYNTHESIS) with state transitions in run_role.py
Decision scoring flow and trigger mapping utility: advanced_score.py, trigger_next.py, registry lookup
Observability and governance validator: aggregate.py, tools/rules/validate.py
Uncertain Workflows:
Automated post-run candidate generation across rules (currently hardcoded in orchestrator_postrun.py)
Missing Workflows:
Automated gate evaluation to produce gate_results.json (referenced by orchestrator post-run)
Confidence Factors: Execution files exist and are runnable; missing parts clearly absent
3. Gap Analysis - Confidence: 9/10
Confirmed Gaps:
DecisionScoringTool class missing; orchestrator_postrun.py imports it
Candidate schema divergence (metrics in score.py vs scores in advanced_score.py and trigger examples)
Registry IDs: unicode arrows/spaces; not aligned with scorer candidate IDs
Memory bridge/master toggle rules are documentation only
No tool creates gate_results.json
Security hardening relies on DRY_RUN, no allow-list or sandbox
Potential Gaps:
Rule-driven candidate generation (scenario router) not integrated programmatically
False Positives: None
ðŸš€ VALIDATED ACTION PLAN
Phase 1: High-Confidence Fixes (Week 1-2) - Confidence: 9/10
Priority: High
Effort: 2â€“4 days
Confidence: 9/10 - Direct, scoped changes; files identified
Dependencies: None
Steps:
Implement DecisionScoringTool adapter in tools/decision_scoring/ wrapping advanced_score.score_candidates; update orchestrator_postrun.py import - Confidence: 10/10
Normalize candidates:
Adopt scores everywhere; extend score.py and orchestrator_postrun to accept metrics and convert to scores - Confidence: 9/10
Registry cleanup:
Rename IDs to ascii-kebab (planning-to-audit, audit-to-verify) and update trigger_next.py examples and tools/decision_scoring/examples/trigger_candidates.json accordingly - Confidence: 9/10
Gate evaluator MVP:
Create tools/gates/evaluate.py to read artifacts and output gate_results.json; call it in run_role.py after transitions - Confidence: 9/10
State consistency:
Add a small utility mapping for phase/state if rules expect phase; or refactor rules to read from workflow_state.json - Confidence: 8/10
Phase 2: Medium-Confidence Improvements (Month 1-2) - Confidence: 7/10
Priority: Medium
Effort: 2â€“3 weeks
Dependencies: Phase 1
Steps:
Programmatic candidate builder reading scenario_router.mdc and current artifacts to produce candidates - Confidence: 7/10
Safety hardening:
Command allow-list and envelope schema validation with checksum - Confidence: 8/10
Memory Bridge MVP (tools/memory/bridge.py) with store/retrieve/search backed by filesystem - Confidence: 7/10
Master Toggle MVP (tools/toggles/master_toggle.py) with JSON config and validation - Confidence: 7/10
Tests for adapters, gates, trigger mapping, end-to-end orchestration - Confidence: 8/10
Phase 3: Low-Confidence Enhancements (Month 3-6) - Confidence: 6/10
Priority: Medium
Effort: 4â€“6 weeks
Dependencies: Phase 2
Steps:
Event-driven orchestrator service to coordinate post-run analysis and triggers - Confidence: 6/10
Containerized sandbox for COMMAND_TRIGGER execution - Confidence: 6/10
Decision metrics dashboards and drift detection - Confidence: 6/10
Rule engine with caching, conflict detection, priority resolution - Confidence: 6/10
CI integration and E2E pipelines - Confidence: 7/10
Security/Compliance Criticals at 9-10 Confidence:
The current lack of sandbox/allow-list is confirmed; DRY_RUN is not enforced formally. Needs Phase 2 hardening.
Uncertainty Resolution Plans
For programmatic candidate generation and orchestrator service, prototype against scenario_router.mdc inputs and current artifacts; validate through new E2E tests.
All items above 7 confidence were verified directly against files in the repo. Critical issues scored at 9-10 confidence.- I finished cross-validating claims with concrete files and confirmed strengths, gaps, and the action plan. The validated report above includes confidence scores and evidence-backed conclusions.
