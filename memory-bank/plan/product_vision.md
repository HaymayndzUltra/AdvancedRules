# Product Vision - Quick Task Manager

## Project Overview
**Project Title:** Quick Task Manager (Web-based)  
**Objective:** Create a simple, efficient task management application for organizing and tracking daily tasks  
**Timeline:** 40-60 hours (1-2 weeks)  
**Budget:** $2500 (fixed-price)  

## Business Value
- **User Productivity:** Streamline task organization and completion tracking
- **Simplicity:** Minimal learning curve for immediate adoption
- **Accessibility:** Web-based access from any device with internet connection
- **Cost-Effective:** Affordable solution for small teams or individual users

## Target Users
- **Primary:** Individual users managing personal tasks
- **Secondary:** Small teams (2-5 people) coordinating simple projects
- **Use Cases:** Daily to-do lists, project task tracking, simple workflow management

## Core Features

### 1. Task Management
- **Create Tasks:** Add new tasks with title and description
- **View Tasks:** Display all tasks in an organized list
- **Update Status:** Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- **Task Persistence:** Store tasks securely in database

### 2. User Interface
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Simple, clean interface with minimal clicks
- **Real-time Updates:** Immediate feedback on task operations

### 3. Data Management
- **Local Storage:** SQLite database for reliable data persistence
- **Data Integrity:** Proper validation and error handling
- **Export Capability:** Future enhancement for data portability

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework:** React.js with modern hooks
- **Styling:** CSS3 with responsive design principles
- **State Management:** React Context or local state
- **Build Tool:** Create React App or Vite

### Backend Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js framework
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Validation:** Input sanitization and data validation
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error responses

### Database
- **Type:** SQLite (file-based, no server required)
- **Schema:** Simple task table with essential fields
- **Operations:** CRUD operations with proper indexing

## Success Metrics
- **Functionality:** 100% of core requirements implemented
- **Performance:** Page load < 2 seconds, API response < 500ms
- **Usability:** Task creation and completion in < 3 clicks
- **Reliability:** 99% uptime during development testing

## Constraints & Assumptions
- **Browser Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Data Volume:** Designed for < 1000 tasks per user
- **Concurrent Users:** Single-user application (no multi-tenancy)
- **Offline Support:** Not required for MVP

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Task categories and tags
- Due dates and reminders
- Task sharing and collaboration
- Mobile app versions
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Basic CRUD operations, well-established tech stack
- **Medium Risk:** UI/UX design quality, responsive design implementation
- **Mitigation:** Focus on core functionality first, iterate on design

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can create tasks with title and description
2. Users can view all tasks in a clear, organized list
3. Users can mark tasks as complete/incomplete
4. All data persists between sessions
5. Application works on desktop and mobile devices
6. API endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
7. Error handling provides meaningful user feedback
