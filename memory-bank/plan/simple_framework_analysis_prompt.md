# Simple Framework Analysis Prompt

## üéØ TASK
Analyze the Quick Task Manager project framework end-to-end and identify gaps, improvements, and action plans.

## üìã WHAT TO ANALYZE

### **1. CHECK EACH PHASE**
Go through each project phase and mark:
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Has everything needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** - Missing some things
- ‚ùå **INCOMPLETE** - Missing major parts

**Phases to check:**
- Project Initiation (Client brief, requirements)
- Planning (Vision, user stories, backlog)
- Design (Architecture, database, API, UI)
- Implementation Planning (Action plan, timeline)
- Quality Assurance (Testing, acceptance criteria)
- Delivery (Deployment, handover, docs)

### **2. FIND THE GAPS**
For each incomplete/partial phase, list:
- What's missing?
- Why is it missing?
- How does it affect the project?
- How much work to fix it?

### **3. PRIORITIZE IMPROVEMENTS**
Sort gaps by:
- üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Must fix before starting
- üü° **HIGH** - Fix soon, affects quality
- üü¢ **MEDIUM** - Fix when possible
- üîµ **LOW** - Nice to have

## üìù EXPECTED OUTPUT

### **A. FRAMEWORK HEALTH SCORE**
Give a score from 1-10 and explain why.

### **B. GAP LIST**
Simple table format:
| Gap | What's Missing | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-----|----------------|---------|---------|----------|
| [Gap name] | [Description] | Critical/High/Medium/Low | [Hours] | [1-5] |

### **C. TOP 3 IMPROVEMENTS**
List the 3 most important things to fix first.

### **D. ACTION PLAN**
Step-by-step plan:
- **Week 1:** Fix critical gaps
- **Week 2:** Fix high priority gaps
- **Week 3:** Fix medium priority gaps
- **Ongoing:** Fix low priority gaps

## üîç SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### **1. Missing Deliverables**
- Are wireframes missing? (Client asked for this)
- Is API contract complete?
- Is project structure defined?
- Is README/setup guide ready?

### **2. Quality Issues**
- Are user stories clear enough?
- Is technical plan complete?
- Are acceptance criteria measurable?
- Is timeline realistic?

### **3. Consistency Issues**
- Do all documents agree on timeline?
- Do requirements match across docs?
- Do technical specs align?
- Do resources match needs?

## üìä SIMPLE SCORING SYSTEM

### **For Each Phase:**
- **10/10** = Perfect, nothing missing
- **8-9/10** = Good, minor gaps
- **6-7/10** = Fair, some important gaps
- **4-5/10** = Poor, major gaps
- **1-3/10** = Very poor, critical issues

### **Overall Health:**
- **9-10** = Excellent, ready to implement
- **7-8** = Good, minor fixes needed
- **5-6** = Fair, significant work needed
- **3-4** = Poor, major rework needed
- **1-2** = Very poor, start over

## üéØ FINAL DELIVERABLES

### **1. Executive Summary**
- Overall score and status
- Number of gaps by priority
- Go/No-go recommendation

### **2. Gap Analysis**
- List of all gaps with details
- Priority ranking
- Effort estimates

### **3. Improvement Plan**
- What to fix first
- Step-by-step actions
- Timeline for improvements

### **4. Implementation Readiness**
- Can we start now?
- What must be fixed first?
- How long to get ready?

**Remember:** Keep it simple, actionable, and focused on what needs to be done to make this project successful.
