- Limited contingency planning

### **4. LOW IMPACT GAPS (Nice to Have)**
- Missing competitive analysis
- Limited scalability planning
- No internationalization considerations
- Missing stakeholder analysis

## üéØ IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

### **A. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**
For each identified gap, determine:
- **Why it exists:** Root cause of the gap
- **Impact assessment:** How it affects the project
- **Dependency analysis:** What needs to be in place first
- **Effort estimation:** How much work to fix it

### **B. IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIZATION**
Categorize improvements by:
- **Urgency:** How soon it needs to be addressed
- **Effort:** How much work is required
- **Impact:** How much it will improve the project
- **Dependencies:** What needs to be done first

### **C. SOLUTION DESIGN**
For each improvement, provide:
- **Specific solution:** What exactly needs to be done
- **Implementation approach:** How to implement it
- **Resource requirements:** What's needed to implement
- **Success criteria:** How to measure improvement

## üìù EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT

### **1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall framework health score (1-10)
- Number of critical, high, medium, and low impact gaps
- Top 3 priority improvements
- Implementation readiness assessment

### **2. DETAILED FLOW ANALYSIS**
For each phase:
- **Flow Status:** Complete/Partial/Incomplete
- **Deliverables Present:** List of existing items
- **Deliverables Missing:** List of gaps

### **3. GAP ANALYSIS MATRIX**
| Gap ID | Description | Impact Level | Root Cause | Dependencies | Effort | Priority |
|---------|-------------|--------------|------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| GAP-001 | [Description] | Critical/High/Medium/Low | [Root Cause] | [Dependencies] | [Effort] | [Priority] |

### **4. IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**
For each gap:
- **Immediate Actions:** What to do right now
- **Short-term Improvements:** Next 1-2 weeks
- **Medium-term Enhancements:** Next 1-2 months
- **Long-term Strategic:** Future planning

### **5. ACTION PLAN**
- **Phase 1:** Critical gap fixes (Week 1)
- **Phase 2:** High impact improvements (Week 2-3)
- **Phase 3:** Medium impact enhancements (Month 2)
- **Phase 4:** Low impact optimizations (Ongoing)
